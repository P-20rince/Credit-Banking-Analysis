# Credit-Banking-Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and analyzing customer transaction data in the BFSI (Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance) domain. The goal was to identify anomalies, analyze spending trends, and compute profitability metrics for a hypothetical financial institution. The project demonstrates proficiency in data cleaning, Python scripting, SQL, and exploratory data analysis.    

## Objectives
  1. Ensure data consistency and correctness:    
    a. Treat invalid data (e.g., age < 18).    
    b. Identify customers exceeding their credit limits.    
  2. Analyze customer transaction trends:    
    a. Calculate monthly spending and repayment for each customer.    
    b. Identify high-value customer segments.    
  3. Enhance profitability insights:      
    a. Impose an interest rate of 2.9% on overdue amounts.    
    b. Compute monthly profit for the bank.    
  4. Visualize findings to support data-driven decision-making.    


## Key Highlights
  1. Anomaly Detection: Treated data inconsistencies and identified cases where customers exceeded credit limits.    
  2. Trend Analysis: Derived insights into customer spending habits, segment profitability, and age group spending patterns.    
  3. Profit Calculation: Applied a dynamic interest rate to overdue amounts and provided monthly profit insights for the bank.    
  4. Actionable Insights: Identified the top 10 highest-paying customers, most profitable categories, and spending-heavy segments.    


## Tools and Technologies
Languages: Python    
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn    
Tools: Jupyter Notebook    

## Key Results
  1. Top Customers: Identified the 10 highest spenders, contributing significantly to bank revenue.
  2. Category Analysis: Found "Normal Salary" as the most profitable spending category.
  3. Bank Profit: Provided a dynamic model for monthly bank profit calculation based on overdue interest.

## What Makes This Project Unique?
  1. Real-World Problem Solving: Tackles common data challenges faced in the BFSI domain.    
  2. Comprehensive Analysis: Covers anomaly detection, trend analysis, and profitability computation.    
  3. Scalable Approach: Provides a framework adaptable for larger datasets and more complex financial scenarios.    

## Future Improvements
  1. Incorporate predictive modeling to forecast customer repayment probabilities.    
  2. Add Power BI dashboards for interactive visualizations.    
  3. Automate the anomaly detection and reporting process.
